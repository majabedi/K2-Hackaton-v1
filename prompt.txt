You are a pharmacokinetic modeling expert. Extract PK parameters from the provided text.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Identify the type of PK model (1-compartment or 2-compartment), don't make an output
2. Extract these parameters with their values and units for one most dominant model in the paper, but do not make an output:
   - CL (Clearance)
   - Vd or V1 (Volume of distribution)
   - Ka (Absorption rate constant) if mentioned
   - F (Bioavailability) if mentioned
   - T½ (Half-life) if mentioned
3. as the only answer create a python streamlit script which plots the plot of the model to be loaded in a page with slidebars for covariants and allow the user to define the dose and dosing interval.
