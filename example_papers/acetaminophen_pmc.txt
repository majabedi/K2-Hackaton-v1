Population Pharmacokinetic Modelling of Acetaminophen

ABSTRACT
This study describes acetaminophen pharmacokinetics in healthy adults. 
A two-compartment pharmacokinetic model with first-order elimination 
best described the disposition of acetaminophen.

METHODS
Pooled data included 116 individuals (18–49 years, 49–116 kg) with 
6095 acetaminophen concentrations available for analysis.

RESULTS
Clearance and central volume of distribution were 24.0 L/h/70 kg and 
43.7 L/70 kg for acetaminophen. Bioavailability and absorption half-life 
were 86% and 12 min for acetaminophen. Absorption lag times were 5.3 min 
for acetaminophen.

The pharmacokinetic parameters for a standard 70 kg adult are:
- Clearance (CL): 24.0 L/h
- Volume of distribution (V1): 43.7 L
- Absorption rate: half-life of 11.5 minutes
- Bioavailability: 86%
- Lag time: 5.3 minutes

DISCUSSION
These parameters are consistent with previously published values for 
acetaminophen in adults. The two-compartment model provided superior 
fit compared to one-compartment model.

CONCLUSION
Acetaminophen exhibits predictable pharmacokinetics with linear 
elimination in the therapeutic dose range.
